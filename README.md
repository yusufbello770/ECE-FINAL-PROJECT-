the key features:

1. Real-Time Traffic Monitoring
Tracks network traffic in real time.
Displays bandwidth usage and connected devices.
Identifies high-traffic users or applications.

2. Packet Analysis
Captures and inspects individual data packets.
Provides detailed information about protocols, source/destination IPs, and ports.
Helps in identifying anomalies or malicious traffic.

3. Protocol Analysis
Breaks down traffic based on protocols (e.g., HTTP, FTP, DNS).
Identifies protocol-specific issues or unusual usage.

4. Bandwidth Utilization Monitoring
Shows bandwidth usage per device or application.
Helps in identifying bottlenecks or overused links.

5. Network Visualization
Graphical representations of traffic patterns and flows.
Topology maps showing device connectivity and traffic paths.

6. Alerts and Notifications
Sends alerts based on predefined thresholds for bandwidth, packet loss, or unusual activity.
Helps in proactive issue resolution.

7. Historical Data Analysis
Stores traffic data for long-term analysis.
Helps in trend analysis, capacity planning, and auditing.

8. Application Performance Monitoring
Monitors application-level traffic.
Identifies performance issues or unauthorized applications.

9. Security Features
Detects and reports suspicious or malicious activities.
Supports integration with intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS).

10. Device and User Identification
Identifies devices and users contributing to network traffic.
Helps in implementing user-specific policies.

11. Customizable Dashboards and Reports
Allows users to create custom views of network metrics.
Provides detailed and summarized reports for stakeholders.

12. Multi-Platform Support
Supports various network environments, including wired, wireless, and cloud networks.

13. Scalability
Handles growing network sizes without degradation in performance.
Supports monitoring for both small and large-scale networks.

14. Anomaly Detection and Behavior Analysis
Identifies unusual patterns that may indicate issues like DDoS attacks or network misconfigurations.
Uses machine learning in advanced tools to predict potential problems.

15. Integration with Other Tools
Works with network management systems, firewalls, and log analyzers.
Allows automation of responses to detected issues.
